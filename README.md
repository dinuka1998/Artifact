### Artifact Overview

Artifact is a simple top-down 2D game in which the players must protect the Artifact from wolves. While the player has to survive 300 seconds to win, the artifact's health is decreasing as time passes, and the player must feed fruit to the artifact to maintain its health. A challenge does not end here. There are two types of wolves, one attacking the Artifact and the other eating fruit from bushes. Once a wolf has eaten a bush, it will not bear more fruit. It is the player's responsibility to be aware of this. The player who survives the time frame will win the game.
